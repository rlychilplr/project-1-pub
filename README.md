the privacy policy is a joke

the video that is included contains copyrighted music, the game is [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) so i believe [this](https://osu.ppy.sh/legal/en/Music_licensing#featured-artist-licensing-terms) applies

i am aware that [this](documentatie/sitemap.png) is not what a sitemap is supposed to look like, this will be improved in the next project.
